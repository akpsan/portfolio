      <h1>Hi! I'm Anand.</h1>

      <p>I'm a web developer from Kerala, India.</p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about using technology to make life easier for you, me
        and for the rest of the world! Besides being a technology enthusiast I
        love taking a walk in the park and birdwatching.
      </p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Here are some of my personal projects that I built when I was learning
        web development.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <details>
            <summary>
              <strong>JSBox</strong> -{' '}
              <span>
                A simple sandbox environment to try out any JavaScript library
                on your browser.
              </span>
            </summary>
            <section>
              <p>
                <strong>Technologies used:</strong>
                <span> React, TypeScript, ESBuild, WebAssembly</span>
                <p>
                  JSBox allow you to write code in your browser and execute it
                  right away! Code is bundled using ESBuild WebAssembly binary
                  and run in a secure sandbox. Output will be rendered onto the
                  browser itself.
